'Kroy' game built by team NP Studios in Java using libGDX - built as part of a second year Computer Science module at the University of York. 

## Client Brief

The year is 2042 and York has been invaded by evil extraterrestrials (ETs) from planet Kroy,
who have set up fortresses in key locations (e.g. York Minster, Clifford Tower) around the
city. While ETs are more technologically advanced and outgun humans, they have a major -
and very convenient - weakness: they evaporate when they come in contact with water. As
the leader of the Resistance, you have taken over York's old Fire Station and you are now in
control of its fire engines. Your mission is to use the fire engines you control to flood the ET
fortresses, and liberate York.

You are to build a single-player game that involves moving fire engines between the Fire
Station and the ET fortresses, avoiding ET patrols on the way, and attacking ET fortresses
when the fire engines’ water canons are within shooting range. Specific features that are
required include:

● Each Fire Engine must have a unique spec in terms of the volume of water it can
carry, its speed, the range and delivery rate of its water canon, and the amount of
damage it can take before it is completely destroyed

● Fire Engines need to return to the Fire Station to repair and refill

● Each ET fortress must have a unique spec in terms of the range of its defensive
weapons, the amount of damage these weapons can deal to Fire Engines over a
period of time, and the volume of water it takes to flood

● Over time the ET fortresses improve and they become harder to flood

● There should be at least four Fire Engines and six different ET fortresses based
(possibly loosely) on real locations in York

● The game is won when all ET fortresses have been flooded and is lost when all Fire
Engines have been destroyed

● After a fixed amount of time following the first attack to an ET fortress, ETs figure out
where the Fire Engines are coming from and destroy the Fire Station. From that point
onwards, your Fire Engines cannot be repaired or refilled

● There should be an embedded mini-game, completely different in style from the main
game, but aligned to the theme of the main game

**For assessment 2 you are required to implement two fire engines and three ET fortresses.
You should not implement patrols or the mini game. Also, in this initial version of the game,
ETs should not be able to destroy the Fire Station and their fortresses should not improve
over time.**
